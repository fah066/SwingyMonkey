## CS 181 Practical 4 Swingy Monkey


We used reinforcement learning to create a monkey that can either jump over to a new vine or swing down on the vine heâ€™s currently holding. You can watch a YouTube video of the staff Q-Learner playing at the game at http://youtu.be/14QjPr1uCac

We mainly used two approaches: Q-learning and binary search tree. 
1. stub_Breadth-First-Search.py - uses BFS to search for optimal jumping strategy;
2. stub_deep-First-Search.py - uses DFS to search for optimal jumping strategy;
3. stub_qlearning.py - uses Q-learning (model-free method) with and without gravity to learn optimal policy.

Note: in order to successfully run the program, you need to install pygame following the instructions at
