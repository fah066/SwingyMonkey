CS 181 Practical 4 Swingy Monkey


We used reinforcement learning to create a monkey A monkey that can either jump over to a new vine or swing down on the vine heâ€™s currently holding.

We mainly used two approaches: Q-learning and binary tree search. 

Note: in order to successfully run the program, you need to install pygame on python 3 in advance.
